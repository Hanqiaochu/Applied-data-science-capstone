1. Background

I am a senior that will graduate in few days. Although my graduation trip has been cancelled due to the outbreak of COVID-19, I
am desired to go to California for graduate school in the future. I have been to Los Angeles for three times and I love the
sunshine, the beach, and the vairous cuisines. I would like to know more about restaurants in LA county.

The purpose of this project is to find safe restaurants in LA county and the most common health code ciolations in restaurants.
With this project, I would have a better idea about the restaurants in LA county and know the safest area I could have food
in the future. 

2. Data Description and solution
I found a dataset of LA County Restaurant Inspections and violations on Kaggle. It contains over 40,000 restaurants in 85 out of
88 cities in LA County. The dataset is originally from Los Angeles County Enviornmental Health and it was last updated two years
ago.
